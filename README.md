Titanic Survival Dataset
Overview
The Titanic Survival Dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not. This dataset is commonly used for predictive modeling and machine learning exercises.


FEATURES:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Binary indicator of whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0) (only available in the training set).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Passenger's gender.
Age: Passenger's age in years.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Usage
This dataset can be used for various purposes, including but not limited to:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distributions and relationships between variables.
Predictive modeling to predict whether a passenger survived based on the available features.
Feature engineering to create new features or preprocess existing ones for modeling.
